The only operation we haven’t mentioned so far is divison - if you have two matrices A and B, what would it mean to divide matrix A by the matrix B?\n\nIn order to answer that quesion, let’s see what does it mean to divide two numbers: for example, if we are given numbers 5 and 7, then to divide number 5 by 7 we have to multiply 5 by \\frac{1}{7}, i.e.5 \\div 7 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}.\n\nWhat is the connection between numbers 7 and \\frac{1}{7}? Well, if we multiply them in any order, we get number 1 as a result:7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 7 = 1\n\nThis also means that the reciprocal value or the inverse of the number 7 is \\frac{1}{7}.\n\nSo, we can see that there are two parts that are crucial when dividing number a by the number b:\n\nFind the inverse \\frac{1}{b} of the number b\n\nMultiply a and \\frac{1}{b}\n\nWe can use this approach to define “divison” of matrices. If we would like to divide matrix A by the matrix B, firstly we need to define what would be the inverse of the matrix B and then we would simply need to multiply A by that inverse.\n\nDefinition\n\nLet A be a n \\times n matrix. We say that a n \\times n matrix X is the inverse of the matrix A ifA \\cdot X = X \\cdot A = I .\n\nIn that case, we say that the matrix A is invertible or regular. The inverse X of the matrix A is denoted by A^{-1}.\n\nNote\n\nOf course, the inverse of the matrix A is denoted by A^{-1} for the same reason why the reciprocal value of the number 7 is denoted by 7^{-1}.\n\nSo, if we would like to divide the matrix A by the matrix B, we would need to find the inverse B^{-1} of the matrix B and then compute A \\cdot B^{-1}. However, here we stumble upon a problem - not all matrices are invertible.\n\nProblem 2.1\n\nShow that the matrix A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{bmatrix} isn’t invertible, i.e. it does not have an inverse.","type":"content","url":"/determinanta#id-2-1-introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

By \n\ndefinition, the vectors are linearly dependent if there is a non-trivial linear combination of those vectors that is equal to the zero-vector 0. So, that is the defining property of the linear dependence. The consequence of such a definition is that if the vectors are linearly dependent, then one of them is a linear combination of others. A lot of students confuse these two notions when they are questioned on it on the Midterms or the Exam, so keep in mind what is the definition and what is the consequence of the definition.\n\nProblem 3.2\n\nCheck if the following vectors are linearly dependent or independent:a_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}  1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad a_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad a_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}.","type":"content","url":"/rang#id-3-2-vectors","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.

Systems of linear equations","lvl2":"4.4 Input-output model"},"content":"In this section we are going to use all of the things we learned about matrices and systems of linear equations to study one important economic model called the input-output model. We are going to use it to model a scenario in which we have different sectors of an economy that interact with each other, meaning that every sector consumes outputs of other sectors in order to produce its output. Alongside every sector consuming a part of outputs of all other sectors, each sector has its own demand which is just the amount of output of that sector that is not being used for further production, but rather for export.\n\nThe assumptions of the input-output model are:\n\nif the inputs into some sector increase p times, then the output of that sector increases p times as well\n\nthe ratio of inputs that a certain sector uses is constant\n\nNote that the first assumption is all about linearity, hence we use linear algebra to study this model.\n\nThroughout this section, we will be using the following notation:\n\ntotal output of the i-th sector  \\dots Q_i\n\nvector of outputs \\dots Q = \\begin{bmatrix} Q_1 & \\dots & Q_n\\end{bmatrix}^T\n\nfinal demand of the i-th sector \\dots q_i\n\nvector of demands \\dots q = \\begin{bmatrix} q_1 & \\dots & q_n \\end{bmatrix}^T\n\nintermediate output \\dots Q_{ij}\n\ntechnical coefficient \\dots a_{ij}\n\nmatrix of technical coefficients \\dots A = [a_{ij}]\n\ntechnology matrix \\dots T = I - A\n\nWe are also going to be using the following formulas of the input-output model:\n\nBasic formulas for the input-output model\\begin{split}\nQ_{ij} &= a_{ij}Q_j, \\quad \\quad Q_i = Q_{i1} + \\dots + Q_{in} + q_i \\\\\n&\\hspace{0.2 cm} \\\\\nTQ &= q, \\quad \\quad T \\cdot Q^{\\text{new}} = q^{\\text{new}}\n\\end{split}\n\nIn order to completely describe the dependencies between the sectors, one needs to calculate all the total outputs Q_i, all the intermediate outputs Q_{ij} and all the final demands q_i. Those values are usually represented using the input-output table:\\begin{array}{c | c | c}\nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_i \\\\\n\\hline\nQ_1 & Q_{11} \\quad \\dots \\quad Q_{1n} & q_1 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\vdots &\\vdots \\\\\nQ_n & Q_{n1} \\quad \\dots \\quad Q_{nn} & q_n\n\\end{array}\n\nProblem 4.6\n\nLet the matrix of technical coefficients be given byA = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.2 & 0.15 & 0.1 \\\\ 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.25 \\\\ 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nand let the vector of outputs be given by Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 100 \\\\ 200 \\\\ 100 \\end{bmatrix}. Find the input-output table of this model.\n\nSolution to \n\nProblem 4.6\n\nThe first column of the matrix A denotes the percentages that the outputs of all sectors play in the production of 1 unit of output of the first sector. Therefore, in order to find the intermediate outputs used by the first sector, we need to multiply the first column of the matrix A by Q_1 = 100. We can use the same reasoning to find the intermediate outputs used by the second and the third sector - we multiply the second and the third column of the matrix A by Q_2 and Q_3, respectively. Therefore, the input-output table is given by\\begin{array}{c | c | c}\nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_i \\\\\n\\hline \n100 & 20 \\quad 30 \\quad 10 & 40 \\\\\n200 & 10 \\quad 60 \\quad 25 & 105 \\\\\n100 & 20 \\quad 40 \\quad 10 & 30\n\\end{array}\n\nProblem 4.7\n\nThe following input-output table is describing a certain economy:\\begin{array}{c | c | c} \nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_i \\\\ \n\\hline \n100 & 30 \\quad 30 \\quad 30 & 10 \\\\ \n150 & 30 \\quad 20 \\quad 60 & 40 \\\\\n150 & 20 \\quad 30 \\quad 40 & 60\n\\end{array}\n\nFind the new input-output table if the new vector of outputs is Q^{\\text{new}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 110 \\\\ 165 \\\\ 165 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nSolution to \n\nProblem 4.7\n\nThe first sector has increased its output \\frac{110}{100} = 1.1 times, so the intermediate outputs that are used by the first sector must increase 1.1 times as well. Therefore, to find new intermediate outputs that are being used by the first sector, we need to multiply the old ones by 1.1. In the same way we can find the intermediate outputs used by the second and the third sector. So, the input-output table is given by\\begin{array}{c | c | c}\nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_i \\\\\n\\hline \n110 & 33 \\quad 33 \\quad 33 & 11 \\\\\n165 & 33 \\quad 22 \\quad 66 & 44 \\\\\n165 & 22 \\quad 33 \\quad 44 & 66\n\\end{array}\n\nProblem 4.8\n\nThe following input-output table is describing a certain economy:\\begin{array}{c | c | c}\nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_i \\\\\n\\hline\n200 & 40 \\quad \\quad 50 & 110 \\\\\n100 & 80 \\quad \\quad 0 & 20\n\\end{array}\n\nFind the new input-output table if the new vector of demands is q^{\\text{new}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 120 \\\\ 60 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nSolution to \n\nProblem 4.8\n\nRemember, the first column of the matrix [Q_{ij}] tells us how many units of all sectors are being used by the first sector in order to produce Q_1 units of output. Similarly, the second column of the matrix [Q_{ij}] tells us how many units of all sectors are being used by the second sector in order to produce Q_2 units of output. Hence, we can easily find the matrix of technical coefficients:A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1/5 & 1/2 \\\\ 2/5 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nTherefore, the technology matrix is given byT = \\begin{bmatrix} 4/5 & -1/2 \\\\ -2/5 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nThe inverse of the technology matrix is then given byT^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 5/3 & 5/6 \\\\ 2/3 & 4/3 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nNow we haveQ^{\\text{new}} = T^{-1} \\cdot q^{\\text{new}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 250 \\\\ 160 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nNow we can find the input-output table in the same way as we did in \n\nProblem 4.6:\\begin{array}{c | c | c}\nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_i \\\\\n\\hline \n250 & 50 \\quad \\quad 80 & 120 \\\\\n160 & 100 \\quad \\quad 0 & 60 \n\\end{array}\n\nProblem 4.9\n\nLet the matrix of technical coefficients be given byA = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0.1 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.4 \\\\ 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nThe outputs of the first and the third sector are given byQ_1 = 10, \\quad Q_3 = 30.\n\nIf the demand of the second sector is q_2 = 1, find the input-output table.\n\nSolution to \n\nProblem 4.9\n\nIn \n\nProblem 4.6 we have seen that it is very easy to find the input-output table if we know the vector of outputs Q = \\begin{bmatrix} Q_1 & Q_2 & Q_3 \\end{bmatrix}^T. So, we only need to find the total output Q_2 of the second sector in order to know what is Q equal to. That output Q_2 can be calculated as follows:\\begin{split}\nQ_2 &= Q_{21} + Q_{22} + Q_{23} + q_2 \\\\\n&= a_{21}Q_1 + a_{22}Q_2 + a_{23}Q_3 + q_2 \\\\\n&= 3 + 0.2Q_2 + 12 + 1 \\\\\n&= 0.2 Q_2 + 16\n\\end{split}\n\nFrom this equation is follows that0.8 Q_2 = 16 \\implies Q_2 = 20.\n\nSo, Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 10 & 20 & 30 \\end{bmatrix}^T and we can find the input-output table in the same way as we did in \n\nProblem 4.6:\\begin{array}{c | c | c}\nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_j \\\\\n\\hline\n10 & 0 \\quad 2 \\quad 6 & 2 \\\\\n20 & 3 \\quad 4 \\quad 12 & 1 \\\\\n30 & 2 \\quad 6 \\quad 3 & 19\n\\end{array}\n\nProblem 4.10\n\nLet the matrix of technical coefficients be given byA = \\begin{bmatrix}0.1 & 0.15 & 0.2 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.15 \\end{bmatrix}\n\nThe final demands of the first and third sector are given byq_1 = 116, \\quad q_3 = 114.\n\nIf the total output of the second sector is Q_2 = 160, find the input-output table.\n\nSolution to \n\nProblem 4.10\n\nAgain, as we have seen in \n\nProblem 4.6, if we know the vector of outputs Q then it is easy to find the input-output table. Hence, we want to find the total outputs Q_1 and Q_3 of the first and the third sector. Following the same reasoning as in \n\nProblem 4.9, those outputs are given by\\begin{split}\nQ_1 & = 0.1Q_1 + 0.15Q_2 + 0.2Q_3 + q_1 = 0.1Q_1 + 0.2Q_3 + 140 \\\\\nQ_3 &= 0.2Q_1 + 0.1Q_2 + 0.15Q_3 + q_3 = 0.2Q_1 + 0.15Q_3 + 130\n\\end{split}\n\nTherefore, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns:\\begin{cases}\n0.9Q_1 - 0.2Q_3 = 140 \\\\\n-0.2Q_1 + 0.85Q_3 = 130\n\\end{cases}\n\nThe solution of this system is given byQ_1 = 200, \\quad Q_3 = 200.\n\nHence, the vector of outputs is given by Q = \\begin{bmatrix}200 & 160 & 200\\end{bmatrix}^T and from here it easily follows that the input-output table is given by\\begin{array}{c | c | c}\nQ_i & Q_{ij} & q_i \\\\\n\\hline\n200 & 20 \\quad 24 \\quad 40 & 116 \\\\\n160 & 60 \\quad 32 \\quad 60 & 8 \\\\\n200 & 40 \\quad 16 \\quad 30 & 114\n\\end{array}","type":"content","url":"/sustavi#id-4-4-input-output-model","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

We are interested in the amount of money will we have after the interest has been paid out.\n\nIf the interest is paid out once a year, then we will havea = p(1+r)\n\nIf the interest is paid out twice a year, then we will have\\begin{split}\n\\text{after six months: } &a = p(1+\\frac{r}{2}) \\\\\n\\text{after twelve months: } &a = p(1+\\frac{r}{2}) \\cdot (1+\\frac{r}{2}) = p(1+\\frac{r}{2})^2\n\\end{split}\n\nGeneralizing, if the interest is paid out x times a year, then  at the end of the year we will havea = p(1+\\frac{r}{x})^x.\n\nIf the interest is being paid-out in very small time intervals - meaning quite a lot of times during a year - then x is a very very big number and we can find the amount of money we will have at the end of the year by using the formula stated above:a = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} p \\left(1+\\frac{r}{x}\\right)^x = p \\cdot \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{r}{x}\\right)^x = p \\cdot e^r.\n\nProblem 5.10\n\nFind the limit \\displaystyle \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{x+2}{x}\\right)^{7x}.","type":"content","url":"/limits#id-5-3-limit-of-a-function","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Mathematics for Business"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Mathematics for Business"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Mathematics for Business","lvl2":"General information"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#general-information","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Mathematics for Business","lvl2":"General information"},"content":"Mathematics for Business is an obligatory course taught during the first semester of the BDIB/BDIE programme at the Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb.\n\nThe course teaches the mathematical skills required for problem solving and decision making in the business world through the use of mathematical models and specialized techniques.
