The only operation we haven’t mentioned so far is divison - if you have two matrices A and B, what would it mean to divide matrix A by the matrix B?\n\nIn order to answer that quesion, let’s see what does it mean to divide two numbers: for example, if we are given numbers 5 and 7, then to divide number 5 by 7 we have to multiply 5 by \\frac{1}{7}, i.e.5 \\div 7 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}.\n\nWhat is the connection between numbers 7 and \\frac{1}{7}? Well, if we multiply them in any order, we get number 1 as a result:7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 7 = 1\n\nThis also means that the reciprocal value or the inverse of the number 7 is \\frac{1}{7}.\n\nSo, we can see that there are two parts that are crucial when dividing number a by the number b:\n\nFind the inverse \\frac{1}{b} of the number b\n\nMultiply a and \\frac{1}{b}\n\nWe can use this approach to define “divison” of matrices. If we would like to divide matrix A by the matrix B, firstly we need to define what would be the inverse of the matrix B and then we would simply need to multiply A by that inverse.\n\nDefinition\n\nLet A be a n \\times n matrix. We say that a n \\times n matrix X is the inverse of the matrix A ifA \\cdot X = X \\cdot A = I .\n\nIn that case, we say that the matrix A is invertible or regular. The inverse X of the matrix A is denoted by A^{-1}.\n\nNote\n\nOf course, the inverse of the matrix A is denoted by A^{-1} for the same reason why the reciprocal value of the number 7 is denoted by 7^{-1}.\n\nSo, if we would like to divide the matrix A by the matrix B, we would need to find the inverse B^{-1} of the matrix B and then compute A \\cdot B^{-1}. However, here we stumble upon a problem - not all matrices are invertible.\n\nProblem 2.1\n\nShow that the matrix A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{bmatrix} isn’t invertible, i.e. it does not have an inverse.","type":"content","url":"/determinanta#id-2-1-introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

Hence, the vector \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3\\end{bmatrix} has three components. The set of all vectors with n components is denoted by \\R^n.\n\nDefinition\n\nLet a_1, \\dots, a_k \\in \\R^n be vectors with n components and let c_1, \\dots, c_k \\in \\R be real numbers. The vectorc_1a_1 + \\dots + c_k a_k\n\nis called a linear combination of vectors a_1, \\dots, a_k.\n\nProblem 3.1\n\nLet a_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix}, a_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}, a_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}. Find the linear combination of these vectors given by v = -3a_1+2a_2-a_3.\n\nDefinition\n\nThe vectors a_1, \\dots, a_k are said to be linearly independent ifc_1a_1 + c_2a_2 + \\dots + c_k a_k = 0 \\implies c_1 = c_2 = \\dots = c_k = 0\n\nOtherwise, we say that these vectors are linearly dependent.\n\nOn the lectures, you have learnt that that if the vectors a_1, \\dots, a_k are linearly dependent, then one of those vectors can be represented as a linear combination of the others.\n\nCommon mistake on the Midterm/Exam\n\nIn the sentence above, notice what is the defining property of linear dependence and what is the consequence of the definition. By \n\ndefinition, the vectors are linearly dependent if there is a non-trivial linear combination of those vectors that is equal to the zero-vector 0. So, that is the defining property of the linear dependence. The consequence of such a definition is that if the vectors are linearly dependent, then one of them is a linear combination of others. A lot of students confuse these two notions when they are questioned on it on the Midterms or the Exam, so keep in mind what is the definition and what is the consequence of the definition.\n\nProblem 3.2\n\nCheck if the following vectors are linearly dependent or independent:a_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}  1 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad a_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad a_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}.","type":"content","url":"/rang#id-3-2-vectors","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.

Here’s how we do it:\n\nGiven the vectors, we make a matrix whose rows are equal to the entries of the given vectors\n\nIf the rank of that matrix is equal to the number of vectors we started with, the vectors are independent\n\nOtherwise, they are dependent\n\nProblem 3.9\n\nDetermine whether or not the following vectors are linearly dependent or independent:\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}.\n\nTheorem\n\nLet A be a square matrix.
