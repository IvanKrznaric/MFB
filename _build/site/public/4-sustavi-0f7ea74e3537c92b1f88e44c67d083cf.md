# 4. Systems of linear equations

## 4.1 Introduction
When we were learning about the determinant of a matrix, we learned how to solve Cramer's systems. Cramer's system is a very special kind of a system because its matrix of coefficients $A$ is invertible. In this chapter, we are going to learn how to solve general systems of linear equations.

First, notice that not all systems of linear equations have a solution.
