# 6. Derivative of a function

## 6.1 Introduction

:::{caution} Example
:icon: false
Imagine you have invested some amount of money $V$ into a bond fond, and the value of your investment depends on the interest rate $r$. Therefore, the value $V$ of your investment depends on $r$, i.e. $V = V(r).$ SUppose that the interest rate slightly increases from $r$ to $r+h,$ where $h$ is some small number.
- How can you approximate the change in your investment value due to this small increase in interet rate?
- How can you express the average rate of change of the investment value?
- What happens to this average rate of change as the change in interest rate becomes very very small?

:::{tip} Definition
:icon: false
Let $f : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function. If it exists, the limit
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{equation*}
is called **the derivative** of the function $f$ at a point $x$. We denote this limit by $f'(x).$
