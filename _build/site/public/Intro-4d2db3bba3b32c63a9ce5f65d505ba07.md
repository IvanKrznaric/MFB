# Mathematics for Business

## General information
Mathematics for Business is an obligatory course taught during the first semester of the BDIB/BDIE programme at the Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb. The course teaches the mathematical skills required for problem solving and decision making in the business world through the use of mathematical models and specialized techniques. The objective is to develop an understanding of the uses of mathematics in the study of economics and business, as well as to foster critical thinking and analytical approach to problem solving. The course covers the wide range of mathematical principles and techniques and their economic applications and thus develops the tools to study economics and business more effectively and with deeper understanding. By the end of the course students should be familiar with the mathematical tools covered in class and be able to use these tools in formalizing and solving problems in economics and business.

## How to pass the course
There are two ways in which you can pass the course - via Midterms or via the Exam. \
**In order to pass the course via the Midterms**, there are certain requirements that need to be met:
- You need to succesfully solve all of the homeworks posted on [Merlin](https://moodle.srce.hr/) prior to the Midterm
- You need to pass all **four** Midterms that will be held throughout the semester (meaning you need to get at least $40\%$ on every Midterm)
- After you have passed all the Midterms, in total you must have achieved at least $40\%$ on the problems, $40\%$ on the theory and $50\%$ altogether
**In order to pass the course via the Exam**, you simply need to get at least $40\%$ on the problems, $40\%$ on the theory and $50\%$ altogether. There are no additional requirements when taking the Exam.
