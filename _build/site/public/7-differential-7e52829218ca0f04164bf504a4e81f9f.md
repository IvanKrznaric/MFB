# 7. Differential of a function

## <span class = "h2-num">7.1 </span><span class = "h2-text"> Implicit differentiation </span>
In high-school, we learned about the *explicit* and *implicit* equation of line:
- explicit form $\displaystyle \quad \dots \quad y = 2x+1$
- implicit form $\displaystyle \quad \dots \quad 2x-y+1 = 0$

The difference between these two forms is that in explicit form we know the formula by which $y$ is given, while in implicit form we don't immediately know that formula (although we can easily compute it). This same method can be used for more general functions.

Consider the function $y(x) = e^x+3.$ This function is given **explicitly** because we are given the formula by which $y$ is given. However, we can preform the following operations:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
y &= e^x+3 \\
e^x &= y-3 \quad / \ln \\
x &= \ln(y-3)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
and arrive at the expression $x-\ln(y-3) = 0.$ This expression is **implict** form of the function $y$ because we don't immediately know the formula by which the function $y$ is given, but we can easily express $y$ from that equation and find the explicit form.

Sometimes, the implict form of a function can be such that we can't explicitly express $y$ from the given equation. Nonetheless, we know how to compute the derivative of implicitly given function, as the following problems show.

So far, we know how to find the derivatives of products, quotients, compositions and implicitly given functions. However, there are still some functions that we don't (yet) know how to differentiate. In this section, we will learn a new method that we'll be able to use to differentiante some functions.

Remember that the derivative of the function $f$ is defined as the limit
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.
\end{equation*}

If $h$ is very very close to $0$, then it follows that 
\begin{equation*}
\label{approx}
f(x+h)-f(x) \approx f'(x) \cdot h.
\end{equation*}

This approximation is very important to us, so we want to give special names to the variables above:

- **<span style = "color: green"> small displacement</span>** $\dots dx = h$
- **<span style = "color:green"> exact change </span>** $\dots \Delta f(x_0) = f(x_0 + dx)-f(x_0)$
- **<span style = "color:green"> the differential </span>** $\dots df(x_0) = f'(x_0) \cdot dx.$

Therefore, the [equation above](#approx) tells us that 
\begin{equation*}
\label{differential}
\Delta f(x_0) \approx df(x_0).
\end{equation*}
In other words, **<span style = "color:red">the exact change in the value of the function can be approximated by the differential.</span>**

Of course, the approximation can be accurate or not, so we need a way of measuring the error we make when using the differential to approximate the exact change:
- **<span style = "color:green"> absolute error </span>** $ \displaystyle \dots \lvert \Delta f(x_0) - df(x_0)\rvert$
- **<span style = "color:green"> relative error </span>** $\displaystyle \dots \frac{\lvert \Delta f(x_0) - df(x_0)\rvert}{\Delta f(x_0)} \cdot 100\%$

:::{note} Problem 7.8
:icon: false
A company sells a product at a price of $p$ euros per unit. The demand function is given by
\begin{equation*}
q(p) = 5000-50p,
\end{equation*}
where $q$ denotes the number of units sold. If the price increases from $p_0 = 20$ to $p_1 = 20.1,$ use the differential to approximate the change in the revenue.

:::{note} Problem 7.9
:icon: false
:label: P79
A business's revenue $R$ depends on the amount $A$ of money they have spent on advertising. Their analysis suggest that the relationship between the revenue and the amount invested in advertising is given by the function 
\begin{equation*}
R(A) = \ln(A) \cdot \sqrt{A + 5}.
\end{equation*}
Currently, the business is spending $14 \hspace{0.1 cm} 600$ euros on advertising and their goal is to increase their revenue by $3\%.$ How much more money do they need to be spending on advertising in order to achieve their goal?

````{solution} P79
:class: dropdown
If we denote by $A_0 = 14 600$ the initial amount of money that is being invested into advertising, then the first approach might be the to find the value of $A$ such that 
\begin{equation*}
R(A) = 1.03 \cdot R(A_0).
\end{equation*}
Since $R(A_0) \approx 1158.81,$ the equation that we need to solve is the following:
\begin{equation*}
\ln(A) \cdot \sqrt{A + 5} = 1193.57
\end{equation*}
This equation is very complicated and we don't know how to solve it using any methods that we know of. Therefore, we need to approach this problem in some other way.

Using the fact that [the differential approximates the exact change](#differential), we have that
\begin{equation*}
\Delta R(A_0) \approx R'(A_0) \cdot dA,
\end{equation*}
where $A_0 = 14600$ is the initial amount of money being invested in advertising. If the business wants to increase their revenue by $3\%,$ then $\Delta R(A_0) = 0.03R(A_0).$ So, from the approximation above, the additional amount of money that needs to be invested in advertising is 
\begin{equation*}
dA \approx \frac{\Delta R(A_0)}{R'(A_0)} = \frac{0.03R(A_0)}{R'(A_0)} = 725.02
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the bussiness needs to invest around $725$ euros more in advertising in order to achieve their goal.

If we would like to check whether or not our approximation was good, we can compute the revenue if the bussines invests $A = 14600 + 725,02 = 15325.02$ euros in advertising:
\begin{equation*}
R(15325,02) = 1193.23.
\end{equation*}
Since the $3\%$ increase of the initial revenue is equal to $1.03R(A_0) = 1193.57,$ we see that our approximation is reasonably good!

:::{note} Problem 7.10

:label: P710
Lucija, a financial analyst at a certain hedge fund, was given a task to model the value $P$ of the fund's portfolio with respect to the interest rate $r$. Based on the available data, Lucija has modelled the relationship between $r$ and $P = P(r)$ with the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
(r-3)^2 \cdot P + P^4 = e^{4r} \cdot (r-3)^2 + 16.
\end{equation*}
If the current interest rate of $r = 3$ increases to $r = 3.75,$ how will that affect the value $P$ of the portfolio this hedge fund manages?

:::{note} Problem 7.11
:icon: false
:label: P711
Marko, a trader at an investment bank, is developing an algorithm that predicts a stock's price $P$ based on the market index $I$. Through statistical analysis, Petar models the relationship using the function 
\begin{equation*}
P(I) = (5I+4)^{\sqrt{I+7}}.
\end{equation*}
Marko's model will be used in live trading only if the error of estimation of the exact change in price stays below $0.5\%$ of the actual stock price. If the current market index is equal to $2$, help Marko determine the maximum displacement of the market index that ensures that the error made using his model remains below the given threshold.
