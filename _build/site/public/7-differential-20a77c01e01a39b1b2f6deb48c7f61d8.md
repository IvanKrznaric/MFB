# 7. Differential of a function

## <span class = "h2-num">7.1 </span><span class = "h2-text"> Implicit differentiation </span>
In high-school, we learned about the *explicit* and *implicit* equation of line:
- explicit form $\displaystyle \quad \dots \quad y = 2x+1$
- implicit form $\displaystyle \quad \dots \quad 2x-y+1 = 0$

The difference between these two forms is that in explicit form we know the formula by which $y$ is given, while in implicit form we don't immediately know that formula (although we can easily compute it).
