# 7. Local extrema. Intervals of monotonicity

## 7.1 Introduction
In the next three chapters, we are going to be dealing with various applications of the derivative of a function. In this chapter, we are going to see how to use the derivative in order to answer the following question:
- How to find local extrema, i.e. local minimums/maximums of a given function?
- How to find the intervals over which the given function is increasing/decreasing?
- How to find the intervals over which the given function is convex/concave?

The answers to all of these questions are going to be algorithmic in nature, meaning we will state the algorithm which will lead us to answers to the questions above. The main thing that we'll use to derive those algorithms is the relationship between the function $f$ and its derivatives.
