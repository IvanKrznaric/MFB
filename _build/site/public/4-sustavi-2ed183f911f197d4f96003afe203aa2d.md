# 4. Systems of linear equations

## 4.1 Introduction
When we were learning about the determinant of a matrix, we learned how to solve Cramer's systems. Cramer's system is a very special kind of a system because its matrix of coefficients $A$ is invertible. In this chapter, we are going to learn how to solve general systems of linear equations.

First, notice that not all systems of linear equations have a solution.
:::{caution} Example
:icon:false
The system of linear equations given by 
\begin{equation*} 
\begin{cases} x+y = 1 \\ x + y = 2 \end{cases} 
\end{equation*} 
obviously doesn't have a solution since $1$ cannot be equal to $2$.

Therefore, we need to answer to questions:
- When does a given system of linear equations have a solution?
- If the given system has a solution, how do we compute it?

## 4.2 Kronecker-Capelli theorem
The following theorem gives us a way of checking if the given system of linear equations does have or does not have a solution.

:::{danger} Theorem (Kronecker - Capelli)
:icon:false
System of linear equations $AX = B$ has at least one solution if and only if 
\begin{equation*}
r(A) = r(A|B).
\end{equation*}

:::{note} Problem 4.1
:icon:false
Check whether or not the following system of linear equations has a solution:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
x+2y+z = 4 \\ 2x+y+2z = 5 \\ 3x+2y+3z = 12
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
:::

:::{note} Problem 4.2
:icon:false
Check whether or not the following system of linear equations has a solution:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
x+2y+3z = 1 \\ -x+3y-21z = 2 \\ 3x+7y+3z = 3
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

## 4.3 Gauss-Jordan method
Now that we know how to check whether or not a given system of linear equations has a solution, we want to know how to explicity compute the solutions (if they exist).

:::{note} Problem 4.3
:icon:false
Using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm, solve the system
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
-2x+y+3z = 1 \\
x+2z = 1 \\
4x-y+5z = 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
:::

:::{note} Problem 4.4
:icon:false
Using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm, solve the system
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
2x+y = 3 \\
3x+5y = 8 \\
5x+6y = 11
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
:::

:::{note} Problem 4.5
:icon:false
Using Gauss-Jordan algorithm, solve the system
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
x+3y = 2 \\
2x+3y+3z = 7 \\
2x+z = 6 \\
3x+9y+3z = 12
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
:::

:::{note} Problem 4.6
:icon:false
Using Gauss-Jordan algorithm, solve the following systems: \
a)
\begin{equation*} 
\begin{cases}
x+y-z = 0 \\ 2x-y+z = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
b) 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
x+y-z+w = 0 \\ 2x-y+z-w = 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

The following diagram tells us the whole story about the number of solutions of a given system of linear equations.

Number of solutions of a system is completely determined by the rank.

## 4.4 Input-output model
In this section we are going to use all of the things we learned about matrices and systems of linear equations to study one important economic model called **the input-output model**. We are going to use it to model a scenario in which we have different sectors of an economy that interact with each other, meaning that every sector consumes outputs of other sectors in order to produce its goods.

The basic assumptions of the input-output model are:
- if the inputs into some sector increase $p$ times, then the output of that sector increases $p$ times as well
- the ratio of inputs that a certain sector uses is constant

Note that the first assumption is all about linearity, hence we use linear algebra to study this model.

Throughout this section, we will be using the following notation:
- total output of the $i$-th sector $ \dots Q_i$
- vector of outputs $\dots Q = \begin{bmatrix} Q_1 & \dots & Q_n\end{bmatrix}^T$
- final demand of the $i$-th sector $\dots q_i$
- vector of demands $\dots q = \begin{bmatrix} q_1 & \dots & q_n \end{bmatrix}^T$
- intermediate output $\dots Q_{ij}$
- technical coefficient $\dots a_{ij}$
- matrix of technical coefficients $\dots A = [a_{ij}]$
- technology matrix $\dots T = I - A$

We are also going to be using the following formulas of the input-output model:
:::{important}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Q_{ij} &= a_{ij}Q_j \\
Q_i &= Q_{i1} + Q_{i2} + \dots Q_{in} + q_i \\
TQ &= q \\
T \cdot \Delta Q &= \Delta q
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
:::

:::{note} Problem 4.7
:icon: false
Let the matrix of technical coefficients be given by 
\begin{equation*}
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0.2 & 0.15 & 0.1 \\ 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.25 \\ 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.1 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
