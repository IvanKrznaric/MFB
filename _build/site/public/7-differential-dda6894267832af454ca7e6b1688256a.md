# 7. Differential of a function

## <span class = "h2-num">7.1 </span><span class = "h2-text"> Implicit differentiation </span>
In high-school, we learned about the *explicit* and *implicit* equation of line:
- explicit form $\displaystyle \quad \dots \quad y = 2x+1$
- implicit form $\displaystyle \quad \dots \quad 2x-y+1 = 0$

The difference between these two forms is that in explicit form we know the formula by which $y$ is given, while in implicit form we don't immediately know that formula (although we can easily compute it). This same method can be used for more general functions.

Consider the function $y(x) = e^x+3.$ This function is given **explicitly** because we are given the formula by which $y$ is given. However, we can preform the following operations:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
y &= e^x+3 \\
e^x &= y-3 \quad / \ln \\
x &= \ln(y-3)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
and arrive at the expression $x-\ln(y-3) = 0.$ This expression in **implict** form of the function $y$ because we don't immediately know the formula by which the function $y$ is given, but we can easily express $y$ from that equation and find the explicit form.
