# 1. Matrices and matrix operations

## 1.1 Introduction

:::{prf:example}
:numbered:false
A certain economy is comprised of the following three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing and energy. Each industry consumes a percentage of outputs from the other industries in order to produce its goods, and those percentages are given in the following table:

**A matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers. If a matrix has $n$ rows and $m$ columns, we say that the **order** of that matrix is $n \times m.$
:::
There are two ways in which we can specifiy a matrix:
- you can write it down explicitly
- we can specify its order and state the formula for computing its entries


```{exercise}
:enumerator:1.1
Consider the matrix $M = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 2 \\ e & \pi & \frac{1}{7} \end{bmatrix}.$
1. What is the order of this matrix?
2. Which element is at the position $(2,1)$ and which is at the position $(1,2)$?
```

```{exercise}
:enumerator: 1.2
Write out a matrix $B = [b_{ij}]$ of order $3 \times 4$ such that $b_{ij} = i^2 - j^2.$
```

## 1.2 Types of matrices
:::{prf:definition}
:numbered:false
A matrix that has the same number of rows and columns is called a **square matrix.** Otherwise, a matrix is called **rectangular matrix.**
:::

:::{prf:definition}
:numbered:false
A square matrix is called
- **diagonal matrix** if all its elements outside the main diagonal are equal to $0$
- **scalar matrix** if it is a diagonal matrix whose entries on the main diagonal are equal
:::

```{exercise}
:enumerator: 1.3
What do we call the following matrices:
:::{math}
:enumerated:false
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \begin{bmatrix} - \sqrt[3]{2} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & - \sqrt[3]{2} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\sqrt[3]{2} \end{bmatrix}?
:::
```

:::{prf:definition}
:numbered:false
A square matrix is called:
- **null-matrix** if all its elements are equal to $0$. Such a matrix is denoted by $\mathbf{0}.$
- **identity matrix** if it is a scalar matrix whose elements on the diagonal are all equal to $1$. Such a matrix is denoted by $I.$
:::

:::{prf:definition}
:numbered:false
A square matrix $A = [a_{ij}]$ is called:
- **symmetric matrix** if its elements satisfy $a_{ji} = a_{ij}$
- **antisymmetric matris** if its elements satisfy $a_{ji} = -a_{ij}$
:::

```{exercise}
:enumerator: 1.4
What do we call the following matrices:
:::{math}
:numbered:false
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 8 \\ 2 & \pi & e^2 \\ 8 & e^2 & \sqrt[4]{3} \end{bmatrix}, \quad \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 3 & 5 \\ -2 & 0 & 7 & 11 \\ -3 & -7 & 0 & 13 \\ -5 & -11 & -13 & 0 \end{bmatrix}?
:::
```

```{exercise}
:enumerator: 1.5
Write out the missing elements so that the resulting matrix is antisymmetric:
:::{math}
:numbered:false
\begin{bmatrix}  \cdot & \cdot & \cdot \\ 92 & \cdot & -1 \\ \sqrt{3} & \cdot & \cdot \end{bmatrix}
:::
```

:::{prf:definition}
:numbered:false
A square matrix $A = [a_{ij}]$ is called:
- **upper triangular matrix** if $a_{ij} = 0$ for all $i > j$
- **lower triangular matrix** if $a_{ij} = 0$ for all $i < j$
:::

```{exercise}
:enumerator: 1.6
Write down the following matrices and determine which one is an upper triangular and which one is lower triangular matrix:
- $U = [u_{ij}]$ of order $3 \times 3$ such that $u_{ij} = \begin{cases} i^3, i \leq j \\ 0, i > j\end{cases}$
- $L = [l_{ij}]$ or order $4 \times 4$ such that $l_{ij} = \begin{cases} i \cdot j, i \geq j \\ 0, i < j\end{cases}$
```

## 1.3 Matrix operations
```{tip}
When defining any operation which involves matrices, you need to answer the following questions:
1. What are the inputs of the operation?
2. What is the results of the operation?
3. How do we compute the result?
```

### Transpose of a matrix

:::{prf:definition}
:numbered:false
Given a matrix $A$ of order $n \times m,$ its **transpose** is the matrix of order $m \times n$ obtained by rewritting the rows of the matrix $A$ as its columns. Such a matrix is denoted by $A^T.$
:::

```{exercise}
:enumerator: 1.7
Find the transpose of the matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}.$
```
