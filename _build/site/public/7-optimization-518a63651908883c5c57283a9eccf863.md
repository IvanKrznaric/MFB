# 7. Local extrema. Intervals of monotonicity
% Embed both the input and output
![](#mylabel)

## 7.1 Introduction
In the next three chapters, we are going to be dealing with various applications of the derivative of a function. In this chapter, we are going to see how to use the derivative in order to answer the following question:
- How to find local extrema, i.e. local minimums/maximums of a given function?
- How to find the intervals over which the given function is increasing/decreasing?
- How to find the intervals over which the given function is convex/concave?

The answers to all of these questions are going to be algorithmic in nature, meaning we will state the algorithm which will lead us to answers to the questions above. The main thing that we'll use to derive those algorithms is the relationship between the function $f$ and its derivatives.

:::{error} Common mistake on the Midterm/Exam
:class: dropdown
A common mistake that students make when they are asked to define an increasing function is that they say that a function is increasing **if** $f'(x) > 0.$ That statement is **<span style = "color:red"> not correct! </span>** \
By definition, a function is increasing if 
\begin{equation*}
x < y \implies f(x) < f(y)
\end{equation*}
Of course, if a function $f$ is increasing, then $f'(x) > 0,$ but having a positive derivative is not the definition of an increasing function, but rather a consequence of the definition. \
Keep in mind what is defining property of something, and what is a consequence of the definition!
