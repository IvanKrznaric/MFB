# 4. Systems of linear equations

## 4.1 Introduction
When we were learning about the determinant of a matrix, we learned how to solve Cramer's systems. Cramer's system is a very special kind of a system because its matrix of coefficients $A$ is invertible. In this chapter, we are going to learn how to solve general systems of linear equations.

First, notice that not all systems of linear equations have a solution.
:::{caution} Example
:icon:false
The system of linear equations given by \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} x+y = 1 \\ x + y = 2 \end{cases} \end{equation*} obviously doesn't have a solution since $1$ cannot be equal to $2$.
