# 7. Local extrema. Intervals of monotonicity

## 7.1 Introduction
In the next three chapters, we are going to be dealing with various applications of the derivative of a function. In this chapter, we are going to see how to use the derivative in order to answer the following question:
- How to find local extrema, i.e. local minimums/maximums of a given function?
- How to find the intervals over which the given function is increasing/decreasing?
- How to find the intervals over which the given function is convex/concave?

## 7.3 Intervals of monotonicity

## 7.4 Convexity and concavity
