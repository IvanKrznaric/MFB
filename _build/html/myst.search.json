The only operation we haven’t mentioned so far is divison - if you have two matrices A and B, what would it mean to divide matrix A by the matrix B?\n\nIn order to answer that quesion, let’s see what does it mean to divide two numbers: for example, if we are given numbers 5 and 7, then to divide number 5 by 7 we have to multiply 5 by \\frac{1}{7}, i.e.5 \\div 7 = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7}.\n\nWhat is the connection between numbers 7 and \\frac{1}{7}? Well, if we multiply them in any order, we get number 1 as a result:7 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 7 = 1\n\nThis also means that the reciprocal value or the inverse of the number 7 is \\frac{1}{7}.\n\nSo, we can see that there are two parts that are crucial when dividing number a by the number b:\n\nFind the inverse \\frac{1}{b} of the number b\n\nMultiply a and \\frac{1}{b}\n\nWe can use this approach to define “divison” of matrices. If we would like to divide matrix A by the matrix B, firstly we need to define what would be the inverse of the matrix B and then we would simply need to multiply A by that inverse.\n\nLet A be a n \\times n matrix. We say that a n \\times n matrix X is the inverse of the matrix A ifA \\cdot X = X \\cdot A = I .\n\nIn that case, we say that the matrix A is invertible or regular. The inverse X of the matrix A is denoted by A^{-1}.\n\nOf course, the inverse of the matrix A is denoted by A^{-1} for the same reason why the reciprocal value of the number 7 is denoted by 7^{-1}.\n\nSo, if we would like to divide the matrix A by the matrix B, we would need to find the inverse B^{-1} of the matrix B and then compute A \\cdot B^{-1}. However, here we stumble upon a problem - not all matrices are invertible.\n\nShow that the matrix A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{bmatrix} isn’t invertible, i.e. it does not have an inverse.","type":"content","url":"/determinanta#id-2-1-introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.
