The course teaches the mathematical skills required for problem solving and decision making in the business world through the use of mathematical models and specialized techniques. The objective is to develop an understanding of the uses of mathematics in the study of economics and business, as well as to foster critical thinking and analytical approach to problem solving. The course covers the wide range of mathematical principles and techniques and their economic applications and thus develops the tools to study economics and business more effectively and with deeper understanding. By the end of the course students should be familiar with the mathematical tools covered in class and be able to use these tools in formalizing and solving problems in economics and business.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"key":"jrdwJp6iqN"}],"key":"mmfwA8i9t2"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Teaching","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"aci3Q9t3fh"}],"identifier":"teaching","label":"Teaching","html_id":"teaching","implicit":true,"key":"BKzTOPMMOa"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How to pass the course","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"ns82WXQPTQ"}],"identifier":"how-to-pass-the-course","label":"How to pass the course","html_id":"how-to-pass-the-course","implicit":true,"key":"F1r7SCNFLZ"}],"key":"kTahD7wNkA"}],"key":"dpqyL66Idk"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}},"footer":{"navigation":{"next":{"title":"1.
