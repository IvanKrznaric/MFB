# 2. Determinant of a matrix

## 2.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter we learned that matrices are very similar to numbers - you know how to add two matrices, how to subtract them and you know how to multiply two matrices. The only operation we haven't mentioned so far is divison - if you have two matrices $A$ and $B$, what would it mean to divide matrix $A$ by the matrix $B$?
