# 2. Determinant of a matrix

## 2.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter we learned that matrices are very similar to numbers - you know how to add two matrices, how to subtract them and you know how to multiply two matrices. The only operation we haven't mentioned so far is divison - if you have two matrices $A$ and $B$, what would it mean to divide matrix $A$ by the matrix $B$?

In order to answer that quesion, let's see what does it mean to divide two numbers: for example, if we are given numbers $5$ and $7$, then to divide number $5$ by $7$ we have to multiply $5$ by $\frac{1}{7},$ i.e.

:numbered:false
5 \div 7 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{7}.
